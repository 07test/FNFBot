The **red** section is where you enter all the data. 

Examples:

- Your games directory
- Selecting Songs

The **green** area is the console, this outputs useful information.

Examples

- What happened when you pressed a keybind
- What notes its planning on hittinh
- When it completes a song

The **blue** section is where the preview of what the notes *probably* look like.

### Keybinds
FNFBot currently has 3 keybinds, and in the future will have modifyable keybinds.

Currently the keybinds are as follows:

| Keybind      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| F1      | Start/Stop Playing the selected map       |
| F2   | Increase the offset        |
| F3   | Decrease the offset        |

Offset = the amount of time in miliseconds to hit before/after the note time.
Default: 25
