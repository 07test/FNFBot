# FNFBot
FNFBot is a FridayNightFunkin bot that plays charts with the challenge of not being able to access/modify any of the games memory!

I simply did this just because I thought it would be fun.

# Usage
To use it, go to the [latest release](https://github.com/KadeDev/FNFBot/releases/latest) and download it.

Run the program and input your friday night funkin game folder (you need to have the data files for the charts, but you can still play it in the browser as well. You just need a download, so like why would you need to play in the browser?????? idk)

Then input the song name in all lowercase, and then the difficulty (hard or easy)

Go into FNF and play the song, when it says "GO" press F1 a bit after that.
Then watch the bot play the song.

# Other keybinds
F1 - Play

F2 - Stop playing

F3 - Add by 1 to the offset (milliseconds between keypresses)

F4 - Remove by 1 to the offset (milliseconds between keypresses)

# Problems
So, obviously its not perfect. In fact, it really can't even beat blammed week 3 all the time.
Here are the issues:

- It can't hit really close notes to eachother, it'll just glitch out.

- When ever it holds a note, it can't hit other ones. (easy fix, too lazy rn though)

# Credits
I used [rqnn's global C# keyboard hook](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46014022) and [Micheal Noonan's Input Simulator](https://github.com/michaelnoonan/inputsimulator) for input and output.

Go give them love.
